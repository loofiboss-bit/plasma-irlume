# YuNet pipeline

This document defines the Milestone 3 production pipeline. The authoritative
constants are in `engine/vision/src/yunet.rs` and the native detector setup is
in `engine/vision-opencv-sys/native/yunet_bridge.cpp`.

## Input and conversion

The worker accepts exactly one bounded frame in `RGB8`, `RGBA8`, or `Gray8`
format. Width is `1..640`, height is `1..480`, and stride may contain padding
but must cover every packed row. Protocol parsing validates the exact payload
length and all multiplication and addition before preprocessing.

Rust converts the original frame into a tightly packed three-channel BGR
buffer:

- `RGB8`: `(R, G, B)` becomes `(B, G, R)`;
- `RGBA8`: alpha is discarded and `(R, G, B, A)` becomes `(B, G, R)`;
- `Gray8`: the value is copied into B, G, and R.

Row padding is ignored. If either dimension is below 64 pixels, Rust
zero-pads only the right or bottom of the BGR buffer to a 64-pixel minimum.
This avoids the degenerate single-feature-cell output observed at smaller
YuNet runtime sizes while preserving the protocol's existing `1x1` minimum.
The original frame is not mutated. There is no normalization, mean
subtraction, scale factor, alpha blending, or color-space heuristic.

## OpenCV inference

The bridge initializes OpenCV 4.13 `FaceDetectorYN` directly from the verified
FP32 ONNX bytes. Immediately before detection, the detector input size is set
to the BGR buffer size: the original frame size unless the documented
64-pixel minimum padding applies.

OpenCV's YuNet implementation creates its DNN blob with scale `1.0`, zero mean,
no channel swap, and no crop. Internally it pads only the right and bottom
edges to the next multiple of 32 using zeros. It does not resize or letterbox
the image. Consequently KFaceAuth applies no coordinate rescaling. Every
rectangle and landmark is still validated against the original, unpadded
frame; output in either padding region fails closed.

The fixed production parameters are:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| score threshold | `0.9` |
| NMS threshold | `0.3` |
| OpenCV `topK` | `5000` |
| emitted face limit | `8` |
| backend/target | OpenCV CPU |

OpenCV performs score filtering and non-maximum suppression. Thresholds are
finite, compiled constants; the benchmark and user configuration cannot
change them.

## Output validation

OpenCV must return a two-dimensional float matrix with exactly 15 columns per
row: rectangle `(x, y, width, height)`, five landmark pairs, and a score.
The bridge rejects another element type, shape, negative row count, or more
than 5,000 rows.

Rust then validates every returned row, including rows beyond the eight that
can be emitted:

- every value must be finite;
- width and height must be positive;
- the rectangle must remain inside the original image;
- all five landmarks must remain inside the original image;
- the score must satisfy the configured threshold within an explicit
  `1e-5` floating-point tolerance and must not exceed one beyond that tolerance.

Validated rectangles are conservatively rounded outward and converted to the
existing bounded integer result. Landmarks and detector scores are discarded;
they are not placed on the worker protocol, in the UI, in logs, or in support
reports. At most eight rectangles are returned.

## Quality and result semantics

Brightness, contrast, and sharpness are calculated from the original accepted
pixel format, not from a detector tensor. Quality calculation is independent
of whether detection returns zero, one, or multiple faces. Quality flags are
neutral framing guidance and are checked for contradictory values before the
KCM displays them.

- zero faces means that this frame produced no detector result;
- one face means that one rectangle passed validation;
- multiple faces means that two to eight rectangles passed validation.

No result identifies a person. Detector score is not identity confidence,
liveness confidence, anti-spoof evidence, or authentication confidence.

## Upstream parity

The implementation follows OpenCV 4.13's `FaceDetectorYN` buffer-loading path,
input-size update, blob parameters, right/bottom multiple-of-32 padding, score
thresholding, and NMS. KFaceAuth's additional below-64 right/bottom padding is
explicitly tested at the smallest accepted frame. Native tests exercise model
loading, no-face inference, input immutability, bounds, and malformed output
shape. Numeric postprocessing tests use the explicit tolerance above rather
than byte equality.

No redistributable positive face photograph is included. Real-provider
automation therefore covers verified loading, preprocessing, invalid input,
postprocessing, and a synthetic black zero-face frame. Positive detections
remain covered through the deterministic test provider until a project-owned,
synthetic, or clearly licensed fixture is reviewed.
